## How do I approach designing software?
#### What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
THere are numerous design skills this project has helped me with. The three primary skills are the ability to think and calculate 3d objects better, apply lighting, and apply textures to 3d objects. Boxes and pyramids have very different approaches than spheres. It took me awhile to wrap my mind around sphere creation. Lighting was very interesting and I learned a lot about it. Finally, texture was very fun and immensely satisfying to see an object start to resemble something.
#### What design process did you follow for your project work?
Setting my scene was the first design decision I had to make. After that I had to make numerous design decisions in my code and objects. I tried to break down my project into smaller components. If I needed to draw a pyramid I would first break it down into the triangles and figure out how to put them together. I also tried to create objects for my different components. I had to refactor my code at times to remove items and add items.
#### How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
My overall design process and approach to coding can be applied to future projects. I need to take larger ideas and break them down into smaller easier to manage items. I also need to be able to refactor code and create objects for different programs. This also applies to the design of my project and taking it one item at a time in a scene.

## How do I approach developing programs?
#### What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I used reference material heavily. OpenGL was new to me and I had to look at documentation and help articles throughout the process. Constantly looking at reference material is not a bad thing. The ability to look at reference material and figure out creative solutions to problems is vital to programming and helped me get through this project.
#### How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was at constant play during development. I started with simple triangles and slowly moved my way to the final project. I would add code, refactor code, and debug all the time with different iterations. Adding one object, refining it, adding a new one, etc. Taking the project step by step helped me achieve the final result.
#### How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
This project has required the most refactoring, iteration, and use of reference material than any I have worked on so far. During the development of this project I found that my code in other programs has also become more iterative and methodical. I have also started to debug more often in other programs I am working on.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I want to go into software engineering and computer science will help me on the path to becoming one. It has helped me look at problems in a different way and changed my workflow.
#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I think that graphics helped me review math that I have not used in a long time. Computational graphics also helped me with my workflow in programs. This was very new to me and helped me reexamine how I approach my projects and how I think about problems. I found myself taking more notes and looking into stuff more than ever and I really enjoyed the whole process.
#### How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
As mentioned previously I think that this helped me hone skills that are vital to my future aspirations. I have also started to gain a better understanding and appreciation for graphics and what is happening behind the scenes. I find myself looking at programs, models, games, and other items in a different light and trying to figure out what is happening behind the scenes.
